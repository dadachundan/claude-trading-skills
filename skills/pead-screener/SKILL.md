# PEAD Screener - Post-Earnings Announcement Drift

Screen post-earnings gap-up stocks for PEAD (Post-Earnings Announcement Drift) patterns using weekly candle analysis to detect red candle pullbacks and breakout signals.

## When to Use

- User asks for PEAD screening or post-earnings drift analysis
- User wants to find earnings gap-up stocks with follow-through potential
- User requests red candle breakout patterns after earnings
- User asks for weekly earnings momentum setups
- User provides earnings-trade-analyzer JSON output for further screening

## Prerequisites

Data sources:
- **Earnings calendar**: Finnhub (Mode A only) — free tier, 60 calls/min
- **Company profiles + historical prices**: Yahoo Finance via `yfinance` — free, no key

Setup:
- Mode A requires a Finnhub API key:
  ```bash
  export FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
- Mode B requires no API key (only Yahoo Finance for prices, which is keyless).
- Mode B input: earnings-trade-analyzer JSON output with `schema_version: "1.0"`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare and Execute Screening

Run the PEAD screener script in one of two modes:

**Mode A (Finnhub earnings calendar):**
```bash
# Default: last 14 days of earnings, 5-week monitoring window
python3 skills/pead-screener/scripts/screen_pead.py --output-dir reports/

# Custom parameters
python3 skills/pead-screener/scripts/screen_pead.py \
  --lookback-days 21 \
  --watch-weeks 6 \
  --min-gap 5.0 \
  --min-market-cap 1000000000 \
  --max-earnings-results 500 \
  --output-dir reports/
```

**Mode B (earnings-trade-analyzer JSON input):**
```bash
# From earnings-trade-analyzer output
python3 skills/pead-screener/scripts/screen_pead.py \
  --candidates-json reports/earnings_trade_analyzer_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json \
  --min-grade B \
  --output-dir reports/
```

### Step 2: Review Results

1. Read the generated JSON and Markdown reports
2. Load `references/pead_strategy.md` for PEAD theory and pattern context
3. Load `references/entry_exit_rules.md` for trade management rules

### Step 3: Present Analysis

For each candidate, present:
- Stage classification (MONITORING, SIGNAL_READY, BREAKOUT, EXPIRED)
- Weekly candle pattern details (red candle location, breakout status)
- Composite score and rating
- Trade setup: entry, stop-loss, target, risk/reward ratio
- Liquidity metrics (ADV20, average volume)

### Step 4: Provide Actionable Guidance

Based on stages and ratings:
- **BREAKOUT + Strong Setup (85+):** High-conviction PEAD trade, full position size
- **BREAKOUT + Good Setup (70-84):** Solid PEAD setup, standard position size
- **SIGNAL_READY:** Red candle formed, set alert for breakout above red candle high
- **MONITORING:** Post-earnings, no red candle yet, add to watchlist
- **EXPIRED:** Beyond monitoring window, remove from watchlist

## Output

- `pead_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` - Structured results with stage classification
- `pead_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` - Human-readable report grouped by stage

- `references/pead_strategy.md` - PEAD theory and weekly candle approach
- `references/entry_exit_rules.md` - Entry, exit, and position sizing rules
